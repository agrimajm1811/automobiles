      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A bullock cart is a two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicle pulled by oxen
        (bullocks). It is used in many parts of the world for transporting goods
        and people. The cart is traditionally made of wood, although modern
        versions may use metal parts. It is a means of transport that has been
        in use for thousands of years and remains popular in rural areas where
        motorized transport is unavailable or unaffordable.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure and Design</h2>
      <p>
        The structure of a bullock cart typically includes a wooden frame
        mounted on wheels. The wheels are usually solid or spoked, and the cart
        is connected to the oxen using a yoke. The design may vary depending on
        the region and purpose of use, but simplicity and functionality are
        common features.

        In many countries, the bullock cart holds cultural and historical
        significance. It represents a way of life that is deeply connected to
        agriculture and rural traditions. In festivals and ceremonies, bullock
        carts are often decorated and used as part of celebrations.

        an essential means of transport in rural and remote regions. Efforts are
        being made to preserve their cultural heritage while finding innovative
        ways to improve their efficiency and durability.
