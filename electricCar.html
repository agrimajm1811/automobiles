            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>An electric car is a passenger automobile powered by an electric traction motor, using electrical energy as its primary source of propulsion.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Advantages</h2>
            <p>Electric cars are quieter, more responsive, and have superior energy conversion efficiency. They generate no exhaust emissions and have a lower overall carbon footprint, even when considering the electricity generation process.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Efficiency</h2>
            <p>Due to the superior efficiency of electric motors, these vehicles produce less waste heat, reducing the need for large, complicated, and maintenance-prone engine cooling systems that are common in internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>
