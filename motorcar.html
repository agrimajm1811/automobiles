            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>A motor car is a self-propelled land vehicle with wheels that is used to transport people or cargo.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <p>The first steam-powered road vehicle was built in 1769 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, a French inventor. The first internal combustion-powered automobile was designed by Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz in 1808. The modern car was invented in 1886 by German inventor Carl Benz.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Features</h2>
            <p>Cars have a variety of controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and lighting. Modern cars also have features like air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Fuel</h2>
            <p>Cars run on fuels like petrol, diesel, and CNG. Electrically charged cars have also become popular.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Safety</h2>
            <p>Driving in a car is safer than riding in a fixed-wing aircraft. However, driving without proper experience can lead to fatal road accidents.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Burning gasoline as fuel pollutes the atmosphere. Cars are equipped with a catalytic converter that reduces pollution by converting harmful gases into carbon dioxide and water.</p>
